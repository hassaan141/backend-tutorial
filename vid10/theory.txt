What and Why
  To store data
  DB is backend
  Backend is 2 things, application server and a database
  Application server handles everything, if it needs something from the DB, it sends a request to the DB to get the info
  If there is a part of a DB that has mulitple childrens, they are called collections
  Collection is a grouping of MongoDB documents

  Database -> Collections -> document
